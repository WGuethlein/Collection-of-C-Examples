# Collection of C++ Examples

This is a collection of a few different projects/assignments that I attempted in University.

**Fibonacci DP**

Example creating a Fibonacci number sequence using Dynamic programming to optimize over simople recursion.
This has been implemented in two different ways, a top-down, as well as a bottom-up solution.


**RollEmPigs**

This is a game created first in my Programming 1 course, then edited later in a DSA course. 

The concept of this game is that a user will play against the "computer" in a dice game. You will roll two die, their totals combined will be added to your total score. If the player rolls a single, 1, the turn score will be reset to zero and the turn will end. If the player roll snake-eyes ( Two 1's ) the players total score is reset and the turn ends. The goal is to be the first player to reach a score of 100.


** ___Sort.cpp**

These are a few random sorting algorithms we covered in a DSA course. Each with n^2 time complexity.
